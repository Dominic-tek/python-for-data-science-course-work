## 📖 Introduction
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) in humanitarian programs is traditionally descriptive, focusing on what has already happened.  
This course work aims to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into M&E to **predict program effectiveness** using secondary data (CSV/Excel).  

The end-users are NGOs who can use predictive insights for:  
- Better resource allocation  
- Early detection of underperforming programs  
- Data-driven decision making  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. To preprocess and clean humanitarian program datasets.  
2. To build a Machine Learning (ML) model that predicts program effectiveness.  
3. To visualize the data **before and after cleaning**.  
4. To evaluate model performance and interpret feature importance.  
5. To provide decision support through predictions and visual dashboards.

## 📊 Methodology
The methodology follows these steps:  
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
2. **Pre-cleaning Visualization**  
3. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**  
4. **Post-cleaning Visualization**  
5. **Model Training & Prediction (Random Forest)**  
6. **Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)**  
7. **Visualization of Results**  
8. **Prediction on New Program Data**
